Scopes in JavaScript
Scopes in JavaScript determine the accessibility of variables. There are primarily two types of scopes:

Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function are considered global and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

Local Scope (Function Scope): Variables declared within a function are local to that function and can only be accessed within it.

Closures in JavaScript
Closures are an essential concept in JavaScript that allows a function to retain access to variables from its outer scope even after that outer scope has finished executing. Closures are created whenever a function is defined within another function.

Closures are useful for creating private variables, maintaining state in asynchronous operations, and implementing encapsulation and data hiding.

Understanding JavaScript objects, scopes, and closures is fundamental for writing efficient and organized code. They are essential concepts for building complex applications and understanding advanced JavaScript features and patterns.
