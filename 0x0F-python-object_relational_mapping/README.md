In Python, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) refers to a programming technique that allows developers to work with relational databases using an object-oriented paradigm. Instead of writing SQL queries directly to interact with the database, developers can use Python classes to represent database tables and objects to represent individual rows in those tables.

The primary goals of ORM are to simplify database interactions, reduce the amount of boilerplate code, and promote code maintainability. Here are some key aspects of Python ORM:

1. **Representation of Database Tables**: Python classes are used to represent database tables. Each class typically corresponds to a table in the database, and each instance of the class represents a row in that table.

2. **Attributes as Columns**: The attributes of the Python class correspond to the columns of the corresponding database table. For example, a class attribute `name` might correspond to a column named `name` in the database table.

3. **Mapping**: The process of associating Python classes with database tables and their columns is called mapping. ORM libraries provide mechanisms to define these mappings either through configuration or using declarative syntax.

4. **CRUD Operations**: ORM libraries provide methods and APIs for performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on database records. These operations are typically performed using methods of the Python class representing the database table.

5. **Querying**: ORM libraries provide querying mechanisms to retrieve data from the database using Python syntax rather than SQL. Developers can write queries using the ORM's query language or methods provided by the library to filter, sort, and join data.

6. **Relationships**: ORM libraries allow developers to define relationships between different tables in the database using object-oriented constructs. Common types of relationships include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

7. **Database Agnostic**: ORM libraries abstract away the differences between different database management systems (DBMS). This allows developers to write database code that is independent of the specific database backend being used.

Popular ORM libraries in Python include SQLAlchemy, Django ORM (part of the Django web framework), Peewee, and Pony ORM. These libraries offer various features and approaches to ORM, allowing developers to choose the one that best fits their project requirements and development style.
